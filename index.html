    <h1>Brazillian Jiu-Jitsu Belt System</h1>
    <h2>Juvenile & Adult Belt System (16 years of age and older)</h2>

    <p>
      Adults may be promoted through belts in the following order: white, blue,
      purple, brown and black. Each belt has 5 levels, a clear belt and then 4
      stripes that may be awarded for time, knowledge, behavior, and tournament
      performance. Instructors decide how long it takes for a student to be
      promoted, as long as the minimum times required for each belt are
      fulfilled. However, a competitor will not be authorized to compete for a
      3rd time at the same belt level if the competitor has been the champion of
      the same tournament for 2 years in a row in a given belt, with the
      exception of black belts.

      The SJJIF recognizes the following additional guidelines to the juvenile
      and adult belt system:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Any grey, yellow, orange, or green belt automatically becomes a blue
        belt at the year of turning 16 years of age.
      </li>
      <li>
        In order to be graded a purple belt at 16 years of age it is required
        that the athlete has spent at least 2 years as a green belt.
      </li>
      <li>
        In order to be graded a purple belt at 17 years of age, it is required
        that the athlete has spent at least 1 year as a green belt and 1 year as
        a blue belt.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the case where an athlete was graded from green belt straight to
        purple belt, then the minimum time required before he can be awarded the
        brown belt is 2 years
      </li>
    </ul>

    The following is the criteria for which instructors may promote students:

    <ul>
      <li>A black belt may promote students from white belt to purple belt.</li>
      <li>
        A 1st degree black belt may promote students from white belt to brown
        belt.
      </li>
      <li>
        A 2nd degree black belt may promote students from white belt to black
        belt.
      </li>
    </ul>
